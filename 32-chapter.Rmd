# Chapter 32 - Can we improve the performance of PhenoFlex?

In this chapter, we explore whether the PhenoFlex model can be improved by changing the way it is calibrated, and what role extreme seasons play in model performance.

## Objective of the analysis

**What was the objective of this work?**

- To check whether the performance of the   PhenoFlex model can be improved
- To see how the choice of calibration     data influences model results
- To test the effect of including very     warm (“marginal”) seasons in the         calibration
  

## Main conclusion

**What was the main conclusion?**

- The model performed worse when very      warm, marginal seasons were included
- Removing these seasons led to better     predictions
- The temperature response of the model    looked more realistic without the        marginal seasons

## Future experimental tests

**What experiments could we conduct to test the hypothesis that emerged at the end of the conclusion?**

- Experiments where trees are exposed to   different winter temperature conditions
- Especially experiments focusing on       unusually warm winters
- Studies that look more closely at how    dormancy is affected under extreme       conditions
