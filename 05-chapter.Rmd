# Chapter 5 — Winter Chill Projections

In this section, we simulate chill accumulation using temperature data and explore potential future reductions due to climate change.

## Data access and processing challenges

**Sketch out three data access and processing challenges that had to be overcome in order to produce chill projections with state-of-the-art methodology**

**Data availability and data volume**

- Early climate model outputs were         difficult to access and distributed as   large global datasets (hundreds of MB    per variable)
- Such datasets were hard to process on    standard computers
- Researchers required location-specific,   manageable datasets
- This challenge was later addressed by    platforms such as ClimateWizard and      AFRICLIM

**Lack of hourly temperature data**

- Most climate projections provide only    daily minimum and maximum temperatures
- Many chill models (especially the        Dynamic Model) require hourly            temperature inputs
- This mismatch required the development   of
  - interpolation methods
  - weather generators to derive hourly      temperature series from daily data

**Automation and reproducibility**

- Chill projection studies typically       involve
  - many locations
  - multiple climate models
  - several emission scenarios
- Manual processing is infeasible at this   scale
- Automated workflows were required for
  - data cleaning
  - chill calculation
  - result visualization
- Programming environments such as R       became essential for reproducible        analyses


## Basic workflow for chill projections

**Outline, in your understanding, the basic steps that are necessary to make such projections**

**Step 1: Collect climate data**

- Obtain temperature data from:
  - weather stations (historical)
  - climate model projections (future)
- Data are usually available as daily      minimum and maximum temperatures

**Step 2: Convert daily to hourly temperatures**

- Hourly temperatures are estimated from   daily Tmin and Tmax
- This can be done using:
  - interpolation formulas
  - weather generators

**Step 3: Calculate chill accumulation**

- Apply a chill model (e.g. the Dynamic    Model)
- Calculate chill accumulation for each    site and year

**Step 4: Compare historical and future scenarios**

- Repeat chill calculations for future     climate scenarios
- Compare results to historical reference   periods
- Quantify potential chill losses or       gains

**Step 5: Summarize and visualize results**

- Present results using:
  - tables
  - maps (e.g. Safe Winter Chill maps)
  - time series or boxplots

**Step 6: Interpret implications**

- Translate results into practical         consequences
- For example:
  - cultivar suitability
  - need for cultivar replacement
  - potential relocation of production       areas
