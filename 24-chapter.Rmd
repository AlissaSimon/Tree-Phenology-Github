# Chapter 24 — Examples of PLS regression with agroclimatic metrics

This chapter shows how PLS regression with agroclimatic metrics works in different climates and where it can fail, especially when chilling and forcing periods overlap.

## Patterns across climates

**Look across all the PLS results presented above. Can you detect a pattern in where chilling and forcing periods could be delineated clearly, and where this attempt failed?**

Across the examples, a clearer separation of chilling and forcing periods can be best observed in:

**cold to moderately cold winter climates**

- Beijing
- Klein-Altendorf
- Croatia
- California

**Patterns which can be observed:**

- winters are consistently cold enough     for chill accumulation
- chill metrics show a small rise in       autumn to winter
- PLS coefficients show positive chill     effects in autumn to winter

**Results:**

PLS clearly identifies
- a chilling window (often October -       January)
- followed by a forcing window (January -   March)


## Reasons for success and failure

**Think about possible reasons for the success or failure of PLS analysis based on agroclimatic metrics. Write down your thoughts.**

PLS struggled in warm winter climates:
- Southern UK
- Tunisia

**Patterns which can be observed:**

- chill accumulation is weak, fragmented,   or overlapping with heat
- chill metrics increase slowly and        irregularly
- forcing and chilling signals overlap     strongly in time

**Results:**

No clear boundary between chilling and forcing phases

**Reasons for success of PLS:**

- Chilling and forcing are temporally      separated -> cold winters → chill        first, heat later
- Strong seasonal signal → clear           temperature seasonality
- appropriate chill metric → dynamic       model performs best across the           different climates 
- Penology is strongly temperature         controlled

**Reasons for failure of PLS:**

PLS performs poorly when
- Winters are too warm
- chilling and forcing overlap
- metric climate mismatch → simpler        chill models fail under fluctuating      temperatures
- biological complexity → photoperiod,     water stress, or genetic effects are     not captured by temperature alone
