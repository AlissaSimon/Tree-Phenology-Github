# Chapter 22 — Successes and limitations of PLS regression analysis

In this chapter, the conditions under which PLS regression can successfully identify chilling responses are discussed, along with key limitations and ways to overcome them.

## When does PLS detect the chilling phase?

**Briefly explain in what climatic settings we can expect PLS regression to detect the chilling phase - and in what settings this probably won’t work.**

**Climatic settings where PLS is likely to work:**

PLS regression can detect a chilling phase when

- winter temperatures lie near the upper   effective range for chill accumulation
- warmer winters consistently reduce       chill accumulation
- there is a monotonic relationship        between temperature and chill            comparison
- typical for mild winters in e.g.         California

**Climatic settings where PLS is likely to fail:**

PLS regression will likely fail to detect a chilling phase when

- winters are frequently cold
- temperatures often fall below the        effective chill range
- warming sometimes increases chill (by    moving temperatures into the optimal     range
- the relationship between temperature     and chill is non-monotonic
- typical for cool to cold climates like   Germany and Beijing

## How can these limitations be addressed?

**How could we overcome this problem?**

- use process-based chill models (e.g.     dynamic model) instead of relying on     temperature correlations
- explicitly calculate chill accumulation   and and forcing accumulation before      modeling phenology
- Separate the dormancy process into:
  - Chill accumulation (non-linear           response to temperature)
  - Forcing accumulation (monotonic          response to temperature)
- Apply mechanistic phenology models that   represent biological processes rather    than the statistical patterns
- Combine PLS with biological constraints   or use it only as an exploratory tool
