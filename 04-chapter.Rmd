# Chapter 4 — Climate Change and Impact Projection

This chapter discusses how global warming affects chill accumulation and flowering timing.

## Drivers of climate change

**List the main drivers of climate change at the decade to century scale, and briefly explain the mechanism through which the currently most important driver affects our climate.**

**Main drivers at decadal to centennial scales:**

- Greenhouse gases (GHGs) (CO₂, CH₄,       N₂O)
- Aerosols
- Surface albedo changes
- Clouds
- Ozone
- Solar variability (minor role in         recent decades)
- Volcanic activity (short-term effects)

**Currently most important driver: Greenhouse gases**

Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere by absorbing long-wave radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface while also allowing short-wave solar radiation to pass through. 
This enhances the natural greenhouse effect, increasing Earth’s mean temperature. 
Human activities, especially fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and land-use change, have caused atmospheric CO₂ concentrations to rise faster and to higher levels than ever before in human history, making GHGs the dominant driver of recent climate change.

## Recent temperature dynamics and causes for concern

**Explain briefly what is special about temperature dynamics of recent decades, and why we have good reasons to be concerned.**

**Characteristics of recent warming:**

- Rapid and global warming since about     1901, visible almost everywhere on       earth
- The temperature is rising faster than    ever before in human history
- The known “hockey stick” pattern is      showing a sharp rise in recent           temperatures
- Temperatures are rising much faster      than during past natural climate         changes

**Why this is concerning:**

- rapid change leave little time for       natural and human systems to adapt
- It increases the risk of positive        feedbacks, such as:
    - Melting ice and snow → reduced           albedo means more warming
    - Permafrost thaw → methane release       → further warming
- Even “moderate” warming targets          (1.5–2°C) represent extreme changes      compared to historical variability

## Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)

**What does the abbreviation ‘RCP’ stand for, how are RCPs defined, and what is their role in projecting future climates?**

**Definition:**

**RCP** stands for **Representative Concentration Pathway**.

- RCPs are greenhouse gas concentration    scenarios used by the IPCC
- They are defined by the additional       radiative forcing (in W m⁻²) expected    by the year 2100
    - Example: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0,        RCP8.5
- The higher the RCP number, the greater   the expected warming

**Role in climate projections:**

- RCPs provide standardized future         forcing pathways
- They serve as inputs to Global Climate   Models (GCMs)
- They allow scientists to explore         different plausible futures rather       than predict a single outcome
- RCPs are the starting point for          climate and impact projections

## Climate impact projection methods

**Briefly describe the 4 climate impact projection methods described in the fourth video.**

**The four main climate impact projection methods are:**

**1. Statistical impact models**

- Use statistical relationships between    climate variables (e.g. temperature,     rainfall) and observed impacts (e.g.     crop yield, species presence)
- Useful for explaining past trends and    projecting future impacts
- Key limitation → assume relationships    remain valid in the future               (stationarity)

**2. Species Distribution Models (SDMs)**

- Relate species occurrence to climatic    variables
- Used to project current and future       habitat suitability
- Results depend strongly on the chosen    algorithm
- Often combined in ensemble modeling to   address uncertainty
- Limited by equilibrium assumptions and   missing non-climatic drivers

**3. Process-based (mechanistic) models**

- Explicitly simulate system processes     using equations
- Common in agriculture, hydrology, and    ecology
- Can test management and adaptation       options
- Major limitations include:
    - Poor understanding of some               processes
    - High parameter uncertainty
    - Risk of imbalance (some processes        over-modeled, others ignored)

**4. Climate analogue models**

- Identify locations today with climates   similar to a site’s projected future     climate
- Use real-world systems to infer future   impacts
- Particularly useful for participatory    learning and adaptation planning
- Limitations include differences in       soils, management,and socio-economic     conditions
