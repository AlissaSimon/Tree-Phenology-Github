# Chapter 27 - The relative importance of chill and heat

In this chapter, we explored how the effects of chilling and forcing temperatures on tree phenology vary across different climates, and why warming does not always lead to earlier spring events.

## Temperature response hypothesis

**Describe the temperature response hypothesis outlined in this chapter.**
  
**General idea:**

- The chapter suggests that the            importance of chilling and forcing       temperatures changes depending on the    climate
- Phenology does not always respond to     temperature in the same way everywhere

**Cold-winter climates:**

- In cold climates, trees usually get      enough chill
- Because chilling is not limiting,        differences in winter temperature do     not matter much
- Bloom or leaf-out mainly depends on      spring (forcing) temperatures
- Warmer springs usually lead to earlier   phenology

**Intermediate climates:**

- In moderately warm climates, chilling    may start to matter
- Warmer winters can reduce chill          accumulation
- This can delay phenology, even if        spring temperatures are warm
- Both chilling and forcing seem to        influence bloom timing

**Warm-winter climates:**

- In warm climates, chilling requirements   may not be fulfilled
- Temperature during the chilling phase    becomes very important
- Further warming does not necessarily     advance phenology
- In some cases, warming can even delay    bloom

**Overall interpretation:**

- The hypothesis suggests a gradual shift   from forcing control to chilling         control as winters get warmer
- This could explain why phenology does    not always advance with climate          warming
- The chapter presents this as a general   idea that still needs more evidence
