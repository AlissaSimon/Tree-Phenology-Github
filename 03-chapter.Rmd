# Chapter 3 — Tree Dormancy

This chapter focuses on understanding dormancy in temperate fruit trees.


## Estimating chilling and forcing requirements 

**Put yourself in the place of a breeder who wants to calculate the temperature requirements of a newly released cultivar. Which method will you use to calculate the chilling and forcing periods? Please justify your answer**

I would use a statistical approach

- experimental method is time consuming    and labor intensive, as you need to      repeatedly collect buds in the field,    place them in the growing chambers and   observe the bud growth 
- the statistical method analyzes field    data together with temperature records
- by applying correlation or regression    approaches, you can identify
  - periods with positive significant        coefficients → chilling phases
  - periods with negative coefficients →     forcing phase
- the statistical method provides an       objective, data-driven estimation of     temperature requirements, can be         updated with new years of data and       allows to model cultivar response under   climate-change scenarios

## Advantages of the BBCH scale

**Which are the advantages of the BBCH scale compared with earlier scales?**

- The BBCH scale provides a unified        coding system applicable to most crops
- Earlier systems (e.g. Fleckinger 1948;   Baglioni 1953) were species-specific
- Growth stages are described using        easily recognizable field traits and a   two-digit numeric code

- BBCH distinguishes:
  - principal growth stages (0–9)
  - secondary growth stages
- This allows a much more precise          description of development
- Earlier scales often used only broad     stages and missed intermediate steps

## Classification of sweet cherry phenological stages

**Classify the following phenological stages of sweet cherry according to the BBCH scale**

- Principal growth stage 5 → reproductive   development or inflorescence emergence   with single buds visible
- Principal growth stage 6 → flowering
- Principal growth stage 8 → ripening or   maturity
