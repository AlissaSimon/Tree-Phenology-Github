## `Exercises` on tree dormancy

1.  ***Put yourself in the place of a breeder who wants to calculate the temperature requirements of a newly released cultivar. Which method will you use to calculate the chilling and forcing periods? Please justify your answer.***

    -\> Statistical method

    -   experimental method is time consuming and labor intensive, as you need to repeatedly collect buds in the field, place them in the grow chambers an observe the bud growth → risk for a new cultivar with unknown behavior
    -   statistical method analyzes field data together with temperature records
    -   by applying correlation or regression approaches, you can identify
        -   periods with positive significant coefficients → chilling phases
        -   periods with negative coefficients → forcing phase
    -   statistical method provides an objective, data-driven estimation of temperature requirements, can be updated with new years of data and allows to model cultivar response under climate-change scenarios

2.  ***Which are the advantages (2) of the BBCH scale compared with earlier scales?***

    -   Universality and standardization
        -   BBCH scale provides a single coding system that can describe the growth stages of most crops
        -   earlier scales e.g. Fleckinger 1948, Baglioni 1953) were species-specific and not easily comparable between crops
        -   easily recognizable field traits with a two-digit numeric code
    -   Detail and clarity
        -   BBCH distinguishes principal (0–9) and secondary growth stages, allowing a precise description of development
        -   Earlier systems had only a few broad stages and missed intermediate steps

3.  ***Classify the following phenological stages of sweet cherry according to the BBCH scale:***

-   Principal growth stage 5 → reproductive development or inflorescence emergence with single buds visible
-   Principal growth stage 6 → flowering
-   Principal growth stage 8 → ripening or maturity
